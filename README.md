This is an interactive web visualisation of open source NRW LIDAR data. I stumbled upon this data during my bachelors thesis and thought this'd be fun for everyone to see. This website was a lot more work than anticipated (what isn't?) and I haven't optimized it much beyond compressing the raw data. I hope you like it!

If you have suggestions and/or like it feel free to contact me or leave a star :).

## What's there to see?
Visit https://nrw.menzinger.io and type in your address to have a look at the colored LIDAR data. Or take a 3D visit to Cologne, Dortmund, DÃ¼sseldorf or Essen. Or whatever you place in NRW you like, really.

## About
I processed about 6TB's of LIDAR data (uncompressed) and ~2TB's of orthographic images, split them into 50x50m tiles and mapped a color to each point. It took a while.
The Website itself is relatively lean. The compressed xyz & color data is hosted on Backblaze B2 Cloud in Amsterdam (all other options would probably bankrupt me pretty soon). Depending on coordinates, I fetch the corresponding tiles an visualize the points using threejs.
